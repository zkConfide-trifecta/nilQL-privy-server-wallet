
## ðŸš€ Nillion LLM / Marlin Integration â€“ TEE-Backed Relays for Privy + NilQL Wallets

We use **Marlin** to relay signed transactions from zkConfideâ€™s **ephemeral server wallets**, which are built on **Privy** and **NilQL**.

Marlin provides **infrastructure inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**, allowing us to:

- Execute **wallet signing, encryption, and relaying** in a secure enclave.
- Keep betting logic, user keys, and transaction sequencing **private and tamper-proof**.
- Prevent censorship and reduce latency in prediction market transactions.
